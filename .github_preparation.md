# GitHub Repository Preparation Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, complete these final steps:

## ✅ Pre-Push Checklist

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd ~/github.com/pooriayousefi/cpp-sdk
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: C++ MCP SDK foundation

- Professional project structure
- MIT License + AUTHORS file
- Comprehensive documentation
- Header-only dependencies strategy
- Namespace design: pooriayousefi::mcp::*
- Build system with C++23 support

This establishes the foundation for the first official C++ SDK
for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cpp-sdk`
3. Description: "Modern C++ implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
4. **Public** repository (important for open-source)
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)

### 3. Add GitHub Remote and Push
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:pooriayousefi/cpp-sdk.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

Add these topics to your repository:
- `mcp`
- `model-context-protocol`
- `cpp23`
- `header-only`
- `cpp-sdk`
- `llm-integration`
- `ai-sdk`

#### About Section
```
Modern, header-only C++ implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
Built with C++23, minimal dependencies, and designed for high-performance
LLM integrations.
```

#### Website
```
https://modelcontextprotocol.io
```

### 5. Create GitHub Issue Labels

Suggested labels:
- `good first issue` (green) - For new contributors
- `help wanted` (purple) - Community help needed
- `documentation` (blue) - Documentation improvements
- `enhancement` (cyan) - New features
- `bug` (red) - Bug reports
- `mcp-protocol` (yellow) - Protocol-related issues
- `transport` (orange) - Transport layer issues
- `dependencies` (gray) - Dependency-related issues

### 6. Enable GitHub Features

- ✅ Issues (enabled by default)
- ✅ Discussions (enable for community engagement)
- ✅ Projects (optional, for roadmap tracking)
- ✅ Wiki (optional, for extended documentation)

### 7. Create Initial GitHub Discussion Posts

#### Post 1: Welcome & Introduction
Title: "👋 Welcome to C++ MCP SDK Development!"

```markdown
# Welcome to the C++ MCP SDK!

This project aims to become the official C++ implementation of the Model
Context Protocol (MCP). We're building a modern, header-only SDK with:

- 🚀 C++23 features (coroutines, ranges, modules)
- 📦 Header-only design (easy integration)
- ⚡ Minimal dependencies (nlohmann/json, asio, cpp-httplib)
- 🎯 Performance-focused for production use cases

## Current Status
We've just completed the foundation phase! See PROJECT_STATUS.md for details.

## How You Can Help
- ⭐ Star the repo to show support
- 👀 Watch for updates
- 💬 Share your use case for C++ MCP integration
- 🤝 Contribute (see NEXT_STEPS.md)

## Roadmap to Official SDK
See PROJECT_STATUS.md for our path to becoming the official C++ MCP SDK.

Looking forward to building this with the community! 🚀
```

#### Post 2: Use Cases & Feedback
Title: "💡 What would you use a C++ MCP SDK for?"

```markdown
We'd love to hear from the C++ community about potential use cases!

## Potential Applications
- Game engines integration
- CAD software with AI assistance
- Scientific computing workflows
- Real-time systems
- Embedded devices
- High-performance trading systems

**What's your use case?** Share below! 👇
```

### 8. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional, Later)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for:
- Build verification on push
- Run tests
- Check code formatting
- Generate documentation

(Can be added after initial core implementation)

### 9. Add GitHub README Badges

Already added to README.md:
- ✅ License badge
- ✅ C++23 badge
- ✅ Header-only badge

Consider adding later:
- CI/CD status badge
- Documentation status
- Code coverage
- Release version

### 10. Create `.gitignore`

```bash
cat > .gitignore << 'GITIGNORE'
# Build outputs
build/
builder
*.o
*.a
*.so
*.exe

# IDE files
.vscode/settings.json
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Dependencies (if using submodules, remove this)
external/

# Generated documentation
docs/generated/

# Test outputs
tests/output/
*.log

# Compiled binaries
bin/
lib/

# CMake
CMakeCache.txt
CMakeFiles/
cmake_install.cmake
Makefile

# vcpkg
vcpkg_installed/
.vcpkg-root
GITIGNORE
```

### 11. Final Verification

Before pushing, verify:
```bash
# Check all files are tracked
git status

# Review changes
git diff --cached

# Ensure no sensitive data
grep -r "password\|secret\|token" .

# Test build still works
g++ -std=c++23 builder.cpp -o builder
./builder --release --executable
```

Title: [Project] cpp-sdk - Modern C++ implementation of Model Context Protocol

I'm building a C++ SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables
LLM applications to connect with external tools and data sources.

Key features:
- Modern C++23 (coroutines, ranges)
- Header-only (easy integration)
- Minimal deps (nlohmann/json, asio, cpp-httplib)
- Zero Boost dependency

The project is open-source (MIT) and aims to become the official C++ SDK
for MCP. Looking for feedback and contributors!

### LinkedIn
```
Excited to announce cpp-sdk - a modern C++ implementation of the Model 
Context Protocol!

After studying the official Go and Rust SDKs, I've designed cpp-sdk with:
✅ C++23 features for modern development
✅ Header-only design for easy integration
✅ Minimal dependencies
✅ Production-ready architecture

This project aims to bring MCP to the C++ ecosystem, enabling high-performance
LLM integrations in game engines, scientific computing, embedded systems,
and more.

The project is open-source (MIT) and community-driven. Contributions welcome!
